Game ends when the player crashes.\n*   **Tracks:**\n    *   **Initial Release:** 3 distinct, visually themed tracks (e.g., Neon City, Desert Canyon, Futuristic Highway).\n    *   **Future Expansion (Out of Scope for Initial Release):**  Potential for additional tracks via updates.\n*   **Vehicles:**\n    *   **Initial Release:** 3 unlockable vehicles, each with slightly different handling characteristics (e.g., speed, acceleration, drift).  Unlockable through score milestones.\n    *   **Future Expansion (Out of Scope):** Potential for additional vehicles.\n*   **Power-Ups:**  Randomly appearing power-ups during gameplay to enhance the experience (e.g., speed boost, temporary invincibility, magnet for score pickups).\n*   **Scoring System:**  Points awarded for speed, drifting, near misses, and collecting score pickups.\n*   **Leaderboards:** Global and friend-based leaderboards to foster competition.\n*   **Visuals:** Vibrant, stylized graphics with particle effects and dynamic lighting.\n*   **Audio:**  Energetic soundtrack and impactful sound effects.\n*   **User Interface (UI):** Clean and intuitive UI for menus, leaderboards, and in-game information.\n\n**5. Core Mechanics**\n\n*   **Driving Model:** Simplified arcade-style driving physics emphasizing responsiveness and drift.  No realistic physics simulation.\n*   **Controls:**\n    *   **Keyboard:** Arrow keys or WASD for steering, Spacebar for boost/drift.\n    *   **Touch:** Virtual joystick for steering, tap for boost/drift.\n*   **Collision Detection:** Simple collision detection for track boundaries and obstacles.\n*   **Procedural Generation (Endless Run Mode):**  Track segments are pre-designed and assembled randomly to create a unique experience each run.  Difficulty increases by introducing more obstacles and reducing track width.\n\n**6. Technical Requirements**\n\n*   **Platform:** Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)\n*   **Technology Stack:**\n    *   **Game Engine:** Phaser.js (or similar 2D JavaScript game framework)\n    *   **Language:** JavaScript\n    *   **Graphics:**  Optimized 2D sprites and textures.  Consider using a tilemap editor for track design.\n*   **Performance Optimization:**\n    *   Texture compression and optimization.\n    *   Object pooling to reduce memory allocation.\n    *   Efficient collision detection algorithms.\n*   **Responsive Design:**  Game UI and gameplay should adapt to different screen sizes and aspect ratios.\n*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**  Thorough testing across supported browsers.\n*   **Deployment:**  Deployable via a static web server (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages).\n\n\n\n**7. Out of Scope (For Initial Release)**\n\n*   Multiplayer functionality.\n*   Advanced vehicle customization.\n*   Detailed vehicle physics simulation.\n*   User account creation and management.\n*   In-app purchases.\n*   Mobile app development (native iOS/Android).", "created_at": "20250323-184336"}]
