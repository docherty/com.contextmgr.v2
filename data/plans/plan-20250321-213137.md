Okay, here's a detailed development plan for "Wander Wheels" in Markdown format, building upon the project brief.  I'm assuming, for this plan, that we're selecting **Three.js** as the game engine due to its widespread adoption, strong community support, and suitability for this type of project.  I'm also assuming a small team (2-3 developers).  **Please read the notes at the end â€“ this plan is a starting point and needs to be adjusted based on team expertise and available resources.**

# Project Overview

This document outlines the development plan for "Wander Wheels," a browser-based open-world driving game. The plan is divided into phases, each with specific tasks and deliverables. The goal is to create a fun, accessible, and visually appealing driving experience within a reasonable timeframe.

# Architecture

*   **Game Engine:** Three.js
*   **Programming Language:** JavaScript (with potential for TypeScript for improved code maintainability)
*   **3D Modeling Software:** Blender (free and widely used)
*   **Core Components:**
    *   **Vehicle Physics:**  Custom implementation using Three.js's `Raycaster` and basic physics equations.  Focus on traction, collision response, and momentum.
    *   **Environment:** Procedural generation (initial version) or pre-designed environment using Three.js's geometry and materials.
    *   **Camera System:**  Dynamic third-person camera controlled by the player.
    *   **User Interface (UI):**  Minimalist UI using HTML and CSS, integrated with Three.js.
    *   **Input Handling:**  Keyboard and mouse input for vehicle control and camera manipulation.
    *   **Asset Management:**  System for loading and managing 3D models, textures, and sounds.

# Development Phases

## Phase 1: Core Mechanics & Environment (4 Weeks)

**Goal:** Establish the fundamental driving mechanics, create a basic environment, and ensure core functionality.

*   [x] **Setup Development Environment:** (1 day) - Install Three.js, code editor, and version control (Git).
*   [x] **Vehicle Physics Prototype:** (5 days) - Implement basic vehicle movement, acceleration, braking, and steering. Focus on responsiveness and feel.
*   [x] **Environment Creation (Basic):** (7 days) - Create a simple, flat environment using Three.js's geometry.  Focus on visual clarity and performance.
*   [x] **Camera System Implementation:** (3 days) - Implement the dynamic third-person camera, allowing the player to control its position and angle.
*   [x] **Input Handling:** (3 days) - Integrate keyboard and mouse input for vehicle control and camera manipulation.
*   [x] **Basic Collision Detection:** (3 days) - Implement basic collision detection to prevent the vehicle from passing through objects.
*   [x] **Initial Testing & Refinement:** (3 days) - Thoroughly test the core mechanics and make necessary adjustments.

## Phase 2: Environment Enhancement & Visual Polish (3 Weeks)

**Goal:** Improve the visual appeal of the environment and add more detail.

*   [ ] **Terrain Generation (Simple):** (5 days) - Implement a simple procedural terrain generation algorithm to create a more varied landscape.
*   [ ] **Environment Assets Creation:** (7 days) - Create basic environment assets (trees, rocks, buildings) using Blender.
*   [ ] **Material Implementation:** (3 days) - Implement realistic materials for the vehicle and environment assets.
*   [ ] **Lighting Implementation:** (3 days) - Implement basic lighting to enhance the visual appeal of the environment.
*   [ ] **UI Implementation (Basic):** (3 days) - Implement a basic UI to display information such as speed and lap time.
*   [ ] **Testing & Optimization:** (3 days) - Test the environment and optimize performance.

## Phase 3: Refinement & Polish (2 Weeks)

**Goal:** Address bugs, optimize performance, and add final polish.

*   [ ] **Bug Fixing:** (5 days) - Address any remaining bugs identified during testing.
*   [ ] **Performance Optimization:** (3 days) - Optimize the game's performance to ensure smooth gameplay on a variety of devices.
*   [ ] **Sound Effects Implementation:** (3 days) - Implement basic sound effects for vehicle sounds and environment sounds.
*   [ ] **Final Testing & Polish:** (3 days) - Conduct final testing and make any necessary adjustments.
*   [ ] **Deployment:** (1 day) - Deploy the game to a web server.

## Phase 4: Future Considerations (Ongoing)

**Goal:** Plan for future enhancements and features.

*   [ ] **Advanced Terrain Generation:** Implement more sophisticated terrain generation algorithms.
*   [ ] **More Detailed Environment Assets:** Create more detailed environment assets.
*   [ ] **Vehicle Customization:** Allow players to customize the appearance of their vehicle.
*   [ ] **Challenges and Time Trials:** Implement challenges and time trials to add replayability.
*   [ ] **Weather Effects:** Implement basic weather effects.



**Notes:**

*   **Time Estimates:** These are rough estimates and may vary depending on the team's experience and the complexity of the tasks.
*   **Flexibility:** This plan is a guideline and should be flexible enough to accommodate changes and unexpected challenges.
*   **Communication:** Regular communication and collaboration are essential for the success of the project. Daily stand-up meetings are recommended.
*   **Version Control:** Use Git for version control to track changes and collaborate effectively.
*   **Testing:** Thorough testing is crucial throughout the development process.
*   **Prioritization:** Prioritize tasks based on their importance and impact on the overall project.
*   **Scope Creep:** Be mindful of scope creep and avoid adding unnecessary features that could delay the project.
*   **Team Roles:** Clearly define roles and responsibilities for each team member.  (e.g., Lead Developer, 3D Modeler, UI/UX Designer)
*   **Contingency:** Allocate time for unexpected issues and delays.  A 10-20% buffer is recommended.
*   **Documentation:** Document the code and design decisions to facilitate maintenance and future development.
