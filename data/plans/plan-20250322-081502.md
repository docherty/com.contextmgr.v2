# Road Trip Adventures - Development Plan

## Solution Overview

"Road Trip Adventures" will be a web-based driving game built using Unity and WebGL, targeting children aged 6-12. The game will focus on providing a fun and accessible open-world driving experience with a stylized low-poly aesthetic and intuitive controls. The core gameplay loop revolves around exploration, character interaction (through animation, not dialogue), and simple vehicle customization.  The game will be designed for ease of development, maintainability, and optimal performance within modern Chrome-based browsers.  We will prioritize a modular design to allow for future expansion and content additions.  The project will follow an iterative development approach, with frequent testing and feedback incorporated throughout the process.

## Architecture

The game's architecture will be based on a modular design within Unity. Key components include:

*   **Game Manager:** Central control for game state, scene management, and overall flow.
*   **Vehicle Controller:** Handles vehicle movement, acceleration, braking, steering, and collision detection.
*   **Environment Manager:** Responsible for loading and managing the open-world environment, including terrain, roads, and landmarks.
*   **Character Controller:** Manages the animation and behavior of all characters (player and NPCs).
*   **UI Manager:** Handles the display of game information (speed, score â€“ if implemented) and any user interface elements.
*   **Customization Manager:** Handles vehicle color and decal customization.
*   **Asset Management:**  A system for efficiently loading and managing game assets (models, textures, sounds).

These components will interact through well-defined interfaces and events, promoting code reusability and maintainability.  The Vehicle Controller will interact with the Environment Manager for collision detection and terrain interaction. The Character Controller will receive instructions from the Game Manager to trigger animations and behaviors. The UI Manager will display information provided by the Game Manager and Vehicle Controller.
