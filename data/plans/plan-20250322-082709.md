# Development Plan

# Horace's Snowy Sprint Development Plan

## Solution Overview

This project aims to develop a web-based skiing racing game, "Horace's Snowy Sprint," inspired by "Horace Goes Skiing." The game will be built using Phaser.js, a 2D game framework, and JavaScript. The development process will be iterative, focusing on core gameplay mechanics first, followed by level design, visuals, and audio.  We'll prioritize a simple, intuitive user experience suitable for children aged 6-12.  The project will follow an Agile development methodology with short sprints (1-2 weeks) to allow for flexibility and continuous feedback.

## Architecture

The game's architecture will be modular, promoting code reusability and maintainability. Key components include:

*   **Game Engine (Phaser.js):** Provides the core game loop, rendering, input handling, and physics engine.
*   **Scene Manager:** Responsible for loading and managing game scenes (start screen, levels, end screen).
*   **Player Controller:** Handles player input and movement of Horace.
*   **Level Manager:** Loads level data, creates game objects (obstacles, collectibles), and manages level-specific logic.
*   **UI Manager:** Handles the display and interaction with the user interface elements (start button, timer, score).
*   **Asset Manager:** Loads and manages game assets (images, audio).

These components will interact as follows: The Game Engine initializes the Scene Manager. The Scene Manager loads the appropriate scene (e.g., start screen). The start screen UI triggers the Level Manager to load the first level. The Level Manager creates the game objects and sets up the level. The Player Controller receives input and updates Horace's position. The UI Manager displays the timer and score. The Asset Manager provides assets to all components as needed.
