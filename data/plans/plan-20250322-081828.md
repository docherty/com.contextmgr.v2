# Development Plan

# Road Trip Adventures - Development Plan

## Solution Overview

"Road Trip Adventures" will be a web-based driving game built using Unity and WebGL, targeting children aged 6-12. The game will focus on providing a fun, accessible, and visually appealing experience with simple driving mechanics and a stylized low-poly aesthetic. The core gameplay loop revolves around free exploration of a predefined open-world environment, with opportunities for cosmetic vehicle customization.  The development will prioritize performance and accessibility to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience across modern Chrome-based browsers.  We will utilize an iterative development approach, with frequent testing and feedback loops to ensure the game meets the target audience's needs and expectations.

## Architecture

The game's architecture will be modular and component-based, leveraging Unity's ECS (Entity Component System) principles where appropriate to optimize performance. Key components include:

*   **Game Manager:**  Handles overall game state, initialization, and scene management.
*   **World Generator:** Responsible for creating and managing the open-world environment.  This will likely use procedural generation techniques to create varied landscapes.
*   **Vehicle Controller:** Manages vehicle movement, physics, and collision detection.  This will be a key area for optimization.
*   **Character Controller:**  Manages the movement and animation of pedestrians and animals.
*   **UI Manager:** Handles the display of game information and menus.
*   **Customization Manager:**  Handles vehicle customization options (color, decals).
*   **Asset Management:**  Handles loading and managing game assets (models, textures, sounds).

These components will interact through Unity's event system and custom message passing to ensure loose coupling and maintainability.  WebGL will be used to deploy the game to web browsers, leveraging Unity's built-in WebGL pipeline.
