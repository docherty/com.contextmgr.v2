# Velocity - Web-Based Racing Game: Development Plan

## Solution Overview

Velocity aims to deliver a fast-paced, arcade-style racing game accessible directly within a web browser. The core design prioritizes immediate engagement and replayability through tight controls, vibrant visuals, and a competitive score-driven experience. The game will initially feature two game modes (Time Trial and Endless Run) with three distinct tracks and three unlockable vehicles.  The development will leverage Phaser.js for its 2D rendering capabilities and JavaScript for game logic.  The focus is on delivering a polished, performant experience across common web browsers and devices, with a clear roadmap for future expansion.

## Architecture

The game's architecture will follow a modular design, separating concerns for better maintainability and scalability. Key components include:

*   **Game Engine (Phaser.js):** Provides the core rendering, input handling, and game loop.
*   **Scene Manager:** Handles transitions between game states (main menu, game modes, leaderboards).
*   **Game Logic:** Contains the core game rules, scoring system, and AI (for Endless Run).
*   **Graphics System:** Manages sprites, textures, animations, and visual effects.  Utilizes a tilemap editor for track design.
*   **Input System:** Handles keyboard and touch input, translating them into game actions.
*   **Audio System:** Plays background music and sound effects.
*   **UI System:** Renders the user interface elements (menus, leaderboards, in-game HUD).
*   **Data Management:** Handles game data (scores, vehicle unlocks, track data).  Initially, this will be simple data structures within the JavaScript code.  Future expansion could involve a server-side database.

These components will interact as follows: The Game Engine provides the foundation. The Scene Manager orchestrates transitions. The Input System relays player actions to the Game Logic. The Game Logic updates the game state and instructs the Graphics System to render the visuals and the Audio System to play sounds. The UI System displays information to the player.
