# Road Trip Adventures - Development Plan

## Solution Overview

"Road Trip Adventures" will be a web-based driving game built using Unity and WebGL, targeting children aged 6-12. The game will focus on providing a fun, accessible, and visually appealing experience with simple driving mechanics and a charming low-poly art style.  The core gameplay loop involves exploring a predefined open-world environment, interacting with animated characters, and customizing a single vehicle.  The game will prioritize ease of use, performance, and visual charm to create a positive and engaging experience for young players.  We will utilize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

## Architecture

The game's architecture will be structured around the following key components:

*   **Game Engine (Unity):** Provides the core framework for game development, including rendering, physics, and input handling.
*   **Scene Manager:** Responsible for loading and managing game scenes (e.g., the open-world environment).
*   **Vehicle Controller:** Handles vehicle movement, acceleration, braking, and steering based on player input.
*   **Physics Engine (Unity's built-in):** Simulates vehicle and character movement and collisions.
*   **Character Controller:** Manages the movement and animation of pedestrians and animals.
*   **UI Manager:** Handles the display of game information (speed, score â€“ if implemented) and any in-game menus.
*   **Asset Manager:** Loads and manages game assets (models, textures, sounds).
*   **Customization Manager:** Handles vehicle customization options (color, decals).

These components will interact as follows: The `Scene Manager` loads the initial scene. The `Vehicle Controller` receives input from the player and applies forces to the vehicle, interacting with the `Physics Engine`. The `Character Controller` animates and moves the characters. The `UI Manager` displays relevant information. The `Asset Manager` provides assets to all components. The `Customization Manager` allows the player to modify the vehicle's appearance, which is then rendered by the game engine.
