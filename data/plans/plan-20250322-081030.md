# Road Trip Adventures - Development Plan

## Solution Overview

"Road Trip Adventures" will be a web-based driving game built using Unity and WebGL, targeting children aged 6-12. The game will focus on providing a fun, accessible, and visually appealing experience through open-world exploration, simple driving mechanics, and charming character animations. The core gameplay loop involves driving around a stylized environment, interacting with animated characters, and customizing the player's vehicle.  The game will prioritize performance and accessibility to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience across a range of modern Chrome-based browsers.  The development process will be iterative, with frequent testing and feedback incorporated throughout.

## Architecture

The game's architecture will be modular, allowing for easier maintenance and future expansion. Key components include:

*   **Game Manager:** Central control for game state, scene management, and overall flow.
*   **Vehicle Controller:** Handles vehicle movement, acceleration, braking, and steering based on player input.
*   **Environment Manager:** Responsible for loading and managing the open-world environment, including terrain, roads, and landmarks.
*   **Character Controller:** Manages the behavior and animation of all characters (player, pedestrians, animals).
*   **UI Manager:** Handles the user interface elements, such as speed display and optional score.
*   **Customization Manager:** Allows players to change the color and apply decals to their vehicle.
*   **Physics Engine:** Unity's built-in physics engine will be used for realistic vehicle movement and collision detection.  Customization will be limited to adjust parameters for a simplified, child-friendly experience.

These components will interact through well-defined interfaces and events, promoting loose coupling and maintainability.  The game will utilize Unity's event system for communication between components, and C# scripting for all game logic.
