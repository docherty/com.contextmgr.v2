# Road Trip Adventures - Development Plan

## Solution Overview

"Road Trip Adventures" will be a web-based driving game built using Unity and WebGL, targeting children aged 6-12. The game will focus on providing a fun, accessible, and visually appealing experience with simple driving mechanics and a charming low-poly art style.  The core gameplay loop involves exploring a predefined open-world environment, interacting with animated characters, and customizing a single vehicle.  The game will prioritize ease of use, performance, and visual charm to create a positive and engaging experience for young players.  We will utilize iterative development, with frequent testing and feedback incorporated throughout the process.

## Architecture

The game's architecture will be modular, allowing for easier maintenance and future expansion. Key components include:

*   **Game Manager:** Central control for game state, scene management, and overall flow.
*   **Vehicle Controller:** Handles vehicle movement, acceleration, braking, and steering based on player input.
*   **Environment Manager:** Responsible for loading and managing the open-world environment, including terrain, roads, and landmarks.
*   **Character Controller:** Manages the behavior and animation of all characters (player, pedestrians, animals).
*   **UI Manager:** Handles the user interface elements, such as speed display and optional score.
*   **Asset Manager:** Loads and manages all game assets (models, textures, sounds).
*   **Physics Engine:** Unity's built-in physics engine will be used for realistic vehicle movement and collision detection.  Customization will be limited to adjust parameters for a simplified and child-friendly experience.

These components will interact through well-defined interfaces and events, ensuring loose coupling and maintainability.  The Asset Manager will provide assets to all other components as needed. The Game Manager will orchestrate the overall game flow and manage transitions between scenes.
