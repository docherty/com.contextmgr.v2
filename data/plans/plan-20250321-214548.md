# Development Plan

# Open World Car Exploration (Web) - Development Plan

## Solution Overview

The project aims to deliver a playable, immersive 3D car driving game accessible through a web browser. We will leverage Three.js for rendering and physics simulation, focusing on a flat, traversable environment with detailed assets and realistic textures. The game will prioritize a smooth driving experience and visual fidelity while adhering to the defined scope and performance targets.  The development will follow an iterative approach, starting with core driving mechanics and environment setup, then progressively adding detail and refinement.  Version control (Git) will be used throughout the project to facilitate collaboration and manage code changes.

## Architecture

The game's architecture will be modular, allowing for easier maintenance and future expansion (within the defined scope). Key components include:

*   **Three.js Renderer:** Handles rendering the 3D scene, including the car, environment, and lighting.
*   **Physics Engine (Three.js Physics):** Simulates car movement, collisions, and basic physics.
*   **Car Model & Controller:** Represents the car object and handles user input for acceleration, braking, and steering.
*   **Environment Manager:** Loads and manages the 3D environment assets, including terrain, objects, and dynamic elements.
*   **Camera Controller:** Manages the third-person camera perspective, following the car.
*   **Blocking Volume Manager:** Defines and enforces the boundaries of the playable area.
*   **Asset Loader:** Responsible for loading 3D models and textures from glTF files.

These components will interact as follows: The Camera Controller will track the Car Model. The Car Model will receive input from the Car Controller and update its position based on physics calculations. The Environment Manager will render the environment based on the camera's position. The Blocking Volume Manager will prevent the car from leaving the defined area. The Asset Loader will provide the necessary 3D models and textures to all components.
